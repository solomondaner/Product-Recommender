# Product-Recommender
Built a product recommender in R that outputs the most likely SKUs that an indivudal customer is willing to buy in ascending order based on the transaction history of the entire customer database. The Product Recommender R script was used on the Sales Data file and the output can be seen in the Output.csv file. 
 ## Other Applications
The same exact code can be used to recommend articles for customer enagement. Check out my other respository "AutoRecommenderUpdate()" to automatically update the Product Recommender.
