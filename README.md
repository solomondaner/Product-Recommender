# Product-Recommender
Built a product recommender in R that forecasts the most likely SKUs each indivudal customer is willing to buy in ascending order based on the transaction history of the customer database. The R folder shows the source code for the R script that one can run on the [data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solomondaner/Product-Recommender/master/data/Sales.csv) to get the Output file located in the data folder as well as the R script to copy into Azure Machine Learning Studio for deployment. The Microsoft Azure folder contains instructions and two screen shots that show how to deploy the model.

 ## Other Applications
The same exact code can be used to recommend articles for customer enagement. Check out my other respoitory "AutoRecommenderUpdate" to automatically update a Product Recommender once it is built.
