# Product-Recommender
Built a product recommender in R that outputs the most likely SKUs an indivudal customer is willing to buy in ascending order based on previous transactions of the entire customer database. The Product Recommender R script was used on the Sales Data file and the output can be seen in the Output.csv file.
