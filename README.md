# Product-Recommender
Built a product recommender in R that outputs the most likely SKUs that an indivudal customer is willing to buy in ascending order based on the transaction history of the entire customer database. The Product Recommender R script was used on the Sales file and the output can be seen in the Output file. 
 ## Other Applications
The same exact code can be used to recommend articles for customer enagement. Check out my function in the "AutoRecommenderUpdate()" to automatically update a Product Recommender once it is built.
